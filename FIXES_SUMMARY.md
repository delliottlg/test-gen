# Critical Issues and Logic Errors Fixed

## 1. Authentication Middleware (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- Added `auth.js` module with API key authentication
- Implemented rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Excluded public routes (`/`, `/health`, `/status`, `/webhook/test-runner`) from auth
- Added support for Bearer and ApiKey authorization headers
- Constant-time comparison for API keys to prevent timing attacks

## 2. API Key Validation at Startup (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- Added `validateApiKeys()` method to check all required keys before startup
- Validates: JIRA_TOKEN, JIRA_EMAIL, GITHUB_PAT, ANTHROPIC_KEY
- Checks for placeholder Jira base URL
- Fails fast with clear error messages if keys are missing

## 3. SQL Injection Fix in Jira Client (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- Fixed JQL query to properly quote project keys
- Changed from `project IN (PROJ1,PROJ2)` to `project IN ("PROJ1","PROJ2")`
- Prevents potential JQL injection attacks

## 4. Race Condition Fix in Scheduler (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- Replaced simple boolean flag with proper locking mechanism
- Added job timeout handling (30 minutes max)
- Implemented stale lock detection and cleanup
- Better tracking of job execution with timestamps

## 5. Counting Bug Fix (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
- Fixed incorrect counting where both processedCount and generatedCount incremented identically
- Now properly returns test count from processTicket()
- generatedCount accurately reflects actual tests generated

## 6. Double Test Filename Generation Fix (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
- Added check for existing test suffixes (.test, .spec, _test, Test, .Tests)
- Prevents generating filenames like `UserService.test.test.js`
- Returns original filename if it already has a test suffix

## 7. Inconsistent Error Handling in GitHub Client (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
- Changed getFileContent() to return consistent result object
- Returns `{content, found, error, message}` structure
- No more mix of null returns vs exceptions
- Better error logging with consistent handling

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to your `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
AUTH_ENABLED=true  # Set to false for local development
```

To generate a secure API key:
```javascript
const AuthMiddleware = require('./src/auth');
console.log(AuthMiddleware.generateApiKey());
```
